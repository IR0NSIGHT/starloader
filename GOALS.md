## End Goals
 - Well defined mod types
   - Client mods - To be installed on clients
   - Server plug-ins - To be installed on servers
   - 'Mod' mods - To be installed on both
     - Have a registry for these that the client downloads.
 - A nice mod API, to avoid the need for mods to re-write every time there is an update
   - The goal is not to make so mods never have to update, but that updating is not hard.
