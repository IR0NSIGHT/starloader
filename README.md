StarMade Modloader

### Notes
Make a copy of your starmade.jar and add that to IntelliJ dependencies, otherwise the modloader sometimes cant overwrite it.

### How to download for developers:
Clone and compile, the libraries needed are:
 - StarMade.jar
 - Everything inside of the lib/ folder

### Installation for users:
* Download (todo: add link)
* Run the jar
* Select your starmade.jar
* Install

### Thanks
Mega's SMModLoader for some code that I copied over
