## End Goals
 - A nice mod API, to avoid the need for mods to re-write every time there is an update
   - The goal is not to make so mods never have to update, but that updating is not hard.

## To do:
 - Polish Trading guild contract mod
 - Make a small website (just a single file), that holds data about all mods [Name, download link from SMD, Restart required]
 - On-Demand modloading, not too bad considering how small it is for now
 - Remove all api.SMModLoader code
 - Submit to Schine for approval
